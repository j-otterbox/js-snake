## Summary

This is a clone of the classic arcade game, Snake, that I built for SDMM. This was a fun project because it was an opportunity to use even more functionality built into the Window interface, specifically setting and clearing intervals to update the game as time passes. Beyond that, this was a great way to get more practice with writing clean code. 

The biggest hurdle I had was figuring out how to move the snake during each cycle while leaving room for adding a new segment if a fruit was consumed by the snake. It took a little trial and error but once it clicked it made perfect sense.
